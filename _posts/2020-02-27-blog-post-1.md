In this tutorial, I will explain how to setup a fully working Windows cloud server in
Google Cloud Platform. You can use this cloud server for artificial intelligence model
training purpose or play your AAA games with it since it has a very powerful GPU
and huge amount of RAM.

**Before we start, what you need**
 - Credit / debit card
 - Gmail Account
 - Government Issued ID (eg. IC, driving license..)

I will divide this tutorial into 4 parts: Register for GCP, Firewall and Quotas, Deployment of server and Setup for gaming.

(1) Register for a trial account from Google Cloud Platform
======
Google offers a 300$ trial credit and 12 months validity for every first time user when
they sign up.
First, we need to go to [GCP (Google Cloud Platform)](https://cloud.google.com/) to register our account. Click on
the Get started for free button and login to your gmail account. Then, fill in your
details as per requested on the website.

Google will need your credit/debit card information so that they can bill you once
the trial credit is exhausted. I recommended to use a low balance debit card to avoid
unnecessary problem. Please note that Google will only starts charging your card
when you enable billing, which by default is disabled.

In certain cases, a verification is needed and this is the part where your ID comes in
handy. You will need to submit your ID for the verification purpose, and normally will
be done within few hours.

(2) Firewall and Quotas
======
Once you finished your registration, head over to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) . You should be able
to see the following page.

Google Cloud Platform Console.


We now need to setup a firewall rule, this will allow us to connect to the instance
later on. Firewall rules can be edited at Menu> Networking> VPC network> Firewall
rules

Click on Create Firewall Rule and configure the rule as below.
Note: The name and description of the rule can be any, as long as it follows the
naming rules.

Target Tags, Source IP ranges, Protocols and ports



After setting up our firewall rule, we now need to increase our quota for GPU in our
region. Head over to Menu> IAM & Admin> Quotas

Clear the filter by going to Metric and select none. Now search for GPU (All regions)
in the textbox and tick it.

You will now left with an option named Computer Engine API, select it and click on Edit Quotas. Fill in your details and click next to fill in the quota you wish to increase
(in this case is 1) and the reason why you need it.

After submitting a request, you will need to wait for approval. You will see the
increased quota once you get approved.

Do the same thing for the Metric “Committed NVIDIA P4 GPUs”. This time, select
your preferred location. I pick asia-southeast1 (Singapore) because it is nearer to my
physical location.

(3) Deployment of Server
======
We can now create our instance by going to Menu> Compute Engine> VM
instances.

Click on Create Instance and you can now pick the configuration you need.

In my case, I picked the following configurations:
 * Singapore
 * N1 Series
 * 8 vCore + 30GB RAM
 * Nvidia Tesla P4 (GRID) - Must GRID else you will get throttled performance
 * 150GB Storage with Window Server 2016 Datacenter (Min 30GB reserved for windows)


**Important**
**In order to add a GPU to your instance, you must enable billing. This will allow
Google to charge your card directly after your trial credit is exhausted /
expired.**

**In order to prevent you got charged for a HUGE amount, a debit card is highly recommended.**

**As renting a server can be VERY EXPENSIVE, I recommend you to shut down
the instance when you’re not using it. Google charges instance by hourly usage,
storage and network for monthly usage.**


With 300$ trial credit, you will be able to have some great time before the credits
finished. Just be aware of the balance and delete the instance before your credits
gone.

After selecting your configurations, you can take a look at the overview of the total
cost at the right upper most corner.

<img src='/images/conf.png'>

Don’t get shocked by the huge amount, that’s the price if you run it 24/7. For our
usage, refer to the hourly charge.

Once you deployed your instance, you can apply the firewall rule that we just
created. Click on the instance name, Edit> Network tags, and type in the tag.

(4) Setup for Deep Learning / Cloud Gaming
======
Now you will be redirected back to the main page where you can see all of your
instance. Click on “Set Windows password” under the column Connect. Set the
username and password, you will need it later to connect to the server. Click the RDP
button to connect after you’re done.

You can download the RDP configuration files or connect it using Chrome.

When you’re inside your server, you need to download either of these software and
connect through them:
 * AnyDesk
 * Teamviewer
 
The reason why we are using a third party remote desktop application is because
Microsoft RDP uses a second display, which will affect our next steps.

We will now download our driver for the GPU that you’ve selected. You can either
find it on [NVIDIA Official website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or this [DIRECT LINK](http://bit.ly/2RUg45N) (Link provided by FlickStiq)

Now at this stage, your server should be fully functional. For those who want to work
on model training, I believe you can start working on your own now. The following
steps are specially designed for those who want to setup game streaming device
using this device.

In order to stream our game smoothly, we will use other third party game streaming
software like [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/) and [Rainway](https://rainway.com/). Both are very good in their own way, it depends on which type of gaming experience you need.

Parsec requires you to download their own application in order to stream, while
Rainway allows you to play it just from your browser (Chrome).

But in this tutorial, I’ll be showing Parsec instead.

Download Parsec from the link above, both on your PC and the server. You will need
to register an account in order to use it.

Open up Parsec from your server, navigate to Settings> Network Settings> Host
Start Port, change it to 8000 . A restart is required for the new setting to take place.
You can also walk around other settings as well. It allows you to configure your
preferred configurations easily.

It’s finally done! You can disconnect from AnyDesk/Teamviewer and try to connect it
via Parsec. You may install your favorite platform such as Steam , Uplay , etc.

Advanced Setting
-----
1. Automate login on every startup.
 - On start menu, search for netplwiz .
 - Uncheck the checkbox “User must enter a username and password…”
 - Click on Apply and OK.
2. Audio Driver and Services
 - Go to Services (start menu), then search for Windows Audio.
 - Double click, change the startup type from manual to automatic.
 - Start, apply, OK.
 - Install [VB-Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
3. Remove user permission restriction
 - Go to Window PowerShell, enter the following command powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

That's it for our post today. Enjoy :)
