In this tutorial, I will explain how to setup a fully working Windows cloud server in
Google Cloud Platform. You can use this cloud server for artificial intelligence model
training purpose or play your AAA games with it since it has a very powerful GPU
and huge amount of RAM.

**Before we start, what you need**
 - Credit / debit card
 - Gmail Account
 - Government Issued ID (eg. IC, driving license..)

(1) Register for a trial account from Google Cloud Platform

I will divide this tutorial into 4 parts: Register for GCP, Firewall and Quotas, Deployment of server and Setup for gaming.
